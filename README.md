# Destyawan Satria Nugraha
## Informatics Student – Universitas Ahmad Dahlan

I’m an Informatics student at Universitas Ahmad Dahlan with a strong passion for Data Science and Machine Learning. I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and developing intelligent systems that address real-world challenges.
With a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, I continuously sharpen my skills in Python, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation. I have also earned a certification in Supervised Machine Learning from DeepLearning.AI, which further strengthens my technical understanding in building predictive models.
I aspire to grow as a data scientist who not only analyzes data but also creates solutions that empower individuals and businesses through technology.
